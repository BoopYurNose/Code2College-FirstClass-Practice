"""
The first thing we need to do in order to create 
a new class is use the “class” keyword and give it a name
"""
# write class declaration here

"""
The next thing that all classes need is an initialization function,
which is just a built-in function that will run 
whenever we create an object of this class.
Inside this function is where we would define any attributes for our class.
"""
# write init function here

"""
Finally a class needs methods, which are functions that are the 
actions that our class can perform
"""
# define a method here


"""
So far, the class is just the general blueprint for our objects.
But we haven't created any specific examples of our class yet.
